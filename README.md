a simple implimentation of Super Tic Tac Toe in javascript.

The rules are:
1. players take turns placing X's and O's on any of the 9 game boards
2. The next move made must be made the board, that corresponds with the last cell played
    (so if you played on the top right cell, the next board that can be played on is the top right board)
3. If the board you're supposed to play on is full, then any open board can be played on

That's basically it! Have fun!
